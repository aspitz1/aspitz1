React | Javascript | TypeScript | Sass | CSS | HTML | Node.js | Express | Sequelize | Postgres
<br><br>
I am a developer and visual artist. I have a passion for learning and problem-solving. I am finishing up a 6 month Front-end Engineering program at [Turing School for Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). There I have been learning JavaScript leveraging the React framework. Outside of the curriculum I have also taught myself to build full-stack applications using Node.js, Express, Sequelize and Postgres. I am currently learning React Native and Next.js. I am working on numerous short projects right now. I will hi-light my favorites in my pinned repos below!
